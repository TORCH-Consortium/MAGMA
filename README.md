# MAGMA

MAGMA (**M**aximum **A**ccessible **G**enome for **M**tb **A**nalysis) is a pipeline for comprehensive genomic analyses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a focus on clinical decision making as well as research.

# Salient features of the implementation

- Fine-grained control over resource allocation (CPU/Memory/Storage)
- Reliance of bioconda for installing packages for reproducibility
- Ease of use on a range of infrastructure (cloud/on-prem HPC clusters/ servers (or local machines))
- Resumability for failed processes
- Centralized locations for specifying analysis parameters and hardware requirements
  - MAGMA parameters (`default_parameters.config`)
  - Hardware requirements (`conf/standard.config`)
  - Execution (software) requirements (`conf/docker.config` or `conf/conda.config`)


# (Optional) GVCF datasets 

We also provide some reference GVCF files which you could use for specific use-cases.

- For **small datasets (20 samples or less)**, we recommend that you download the `EXIT_RIF GVCF` files from https://zenodo.org/record/8054182
containing GVCF reference dataset for ~600 samples is provided for augmenting smaller datasets

- For including **Mtb lineages and outgroup (M. canettii) in the phylogenetic tree**, you can download the `LineagesAndOutgroup` files from https://zenodo.org/record/8233518


```
use_ref_exit_rif_gvcf = false
ref_exit_rif_gvcf =  "/path/to/FILE.g.vcf.gz" 
ref_exit_rif_gvcf_tbi =  "/path/to/FILE.g.vcf.gz.tbi"
```

## Tutorials and Presentations

For the tutorials(./docs/tutorials.md) and [presentations](./docs/presentations.md) please refer the [docs](./docs) folder.

## Prerequisites

### Nextflow

- `git` : The version control in the pipeline.
- `Java-11` or `Java-17` LTS release (preferred)

> :warning: **Check `java` version!**:
The `java` version should NOT be an `internal jdk` release! You can check the release via `java --version`


```bash 

$ java -version
openjdk version "17.0.7" 2023-04-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.7+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.7+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)

```


- Download Nextflow

```bash
$ curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

- Make Nextflow executable

```sh
$ chmod +x nextflow
```

- Add `nextflow` to your `path` (for example `/usr/local/bin/`)

```sh
$ mv nextflow /usr/local/bin

```

- Sanity check for `nextflow` installation

```console
$ nextflow info

  Version: 23.04.1 build 5866
  Created: 15-04-2023 06:51 UTC (08:51 SAST)
  System: Mac OS X 12.6.5
  Runtime: Groovy 3.0.16 on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 17.0.7+7-LTS
  Encoding: UTF-8 (UTF-8)

```

> :heavy_check_mark: **With this you're all set with Nextflow. Next stop, conda or docker - pick one!**: <br>

## Customizing pipeline parameters for your dataset

The pipeline parameters are distinct from Nextflow parameters, and therefore it is recommended that they are provided using a `yml` file as shown below


```yml

# Sample contents of my_parameters_1.yml file

input_samplesheet: /path/to/your_samplesheet.csv
only_validate_fastqs: true
conda_envs_location: /path/to/both/conda_envs
```


> **Note**
The `-profile` mechanism is used to enable infrastructure specific settings of the pipeline. The example below, assumes you are using `conda` based setup.


Which could be provided to the pipeline using `-params-file` parameter as shown below

```console
nextflow run 'https://github.com/TORCH-Consortium/MAGMA' \
		 -profile conda_local \ 
		 -r v1.1.1 \
		 -params-file  my_parameters_1.yml

```

## Mention Tower Launch

You can also use Seqera Platform (aka Nextflow Tower) to run the pipeline on any of the supported cloud platforms and monitoring the pipeline execution.

Please refer the [Tower docs](https://help.tower.nf/) for further information.


## Running MAGMA using conda

You can run the pipeline using Conda, Mamba or Micromamba package managers to install all the prerequisite softwares from popular repositories such as bioconda and conda-forge.

You can use the `conda` based setup for the pipeline for running MAGMA 
- On a local linux machine(e.g. your laptop or a university server)
- On an HPC cluster (e.g. SLURM, PBS) in case you don't have access to container systems like Singularity, Podman or Docker 

All the requisite softwares have been provided as a `conda` recipe (i.e. `yml` files) 
- [magma-env-1.yml](./conda_envs/magma-env-1.yml)
- [magma-env-2.yml](./conda_envs/magma-env-2.yml)

These files can be downloaded using the following commands

```console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TORCH-Consortium/MAGMA/master/conda_envs/magma-env-2.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TORCH-Consortium/MAGMA/master/conda_envs/magma-env-1.yml

```

The `conda` environments are expected by the `conda_local` profile of the pipeline, it is recommended that it should be created **prior** to the use of the pipeline, using the following commands. Note that if you have `mamba` (or `micromamba`) available you can rely upon that instead of `conda`.


```sh
$ conda env create -n magma-env-1 --file magma-env-1.yml

$ conda env create -n magma-env-2 --file magma-env-2.yml
```

Once the environments are created, you can make use of the pipeline parameter `conda_envs_location` to inform the pipeline of the names and location of the conda envs.

> :information_source: **Conda environments and cheatsheet**: <br>
You can find out the location of conda environments using `conda env list`. [Here's](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) a useful cheatsheet for conda operations.

## Running MAGMA using docker

We provide [two docker containers](https://github.com/orgs/TORCH-Consortium/packages?repo_name=MAGMA) with the pipeline so that you could just download and run the pipeline with them. There is **NO** need to create any docker containers, just download and enable the `docker` profile.

> ðŸš§ **Container build script**: The script used to build these containers is provided [here](./containers/build.sh).

Although, you don't need to pull the containers manually, but should you need to, you could use the following commands to pull the pre-built and provided containers 

```console
docker pull ghcr.io/torch-consortium/magma/magma-container-1:1.1.1

docker pull ghcr.io/torch-consortium/magma/magma-container-2:1.1.1
```


> :memo: **Have singularity or podman instead?**: <br>
If you do have access to Singularity or Podman, then owing to their compatibility with Docker, you can still use the provided docker containers.

Here's the command which should be used 

```console
nextflow run 'https://github.com/torch-consortium/magma' \
		 -params-file my_parameters_2.yml \
		 -profile docker \
		 -r v1.1.1 
```

> :bulb: **Hint**: <br>
You could use `-r` option of Nextflow for working with any specific version/branch of the pipeline.

## Customizing the pipeline configuration for your infrastructure

There might be cases when you need to customize the default configuration such as `cpus` and `memory` etc. For these cases, it is recommended you refer Nextflow configuration docs as well as the [default_params.config](./default_params.config) file.

Shown below is one sample configuration

- `custom.config` => Ideally this file should only contain hardware level configurations such as 

```nextflow

process {
    errorStrategy = { task.attempt < 3 ? 'retry' : 'ignore' }

    time = '1h'
    cpus = 8
    memory = 8.GB

   withName:FASTQ_VALIDATOR {
      cpus = 2
      memory = 4.GB
   }
}
```

You can then include this configuration as part of the pipeline invocation command 

```console
nextflow run 'https://github.com/torch-consortium/magma' \
		 -profile docker \
		 -r v1.1.1 \
                 -c custom.config \
		 -params-file my_parameters_2.yml
```

2. Cloud batch (AWS/Google/Azure) based execution for MAGMA, please refer [this doc](./docs/cloud_batch_execution.md)
